# Implementation of Trainer

This code uses a trained model from TensorFlow and NLTK for natural language processing.

## Libraries

- `gtts`: Google Text-to-Speech for converting text to speech.
- `speech_recognition`: Library for speech recognition.
- `gTTS`: Google Text-to-Speech for creating audio files from text.
- `os`: Operating system-related functions.
- `playsound`: Library for playing sound files.
- `time`: Library for time-related functions.
- `training.Trainer`: Custom class for training the chatbot model.
- `numpy`: Library for numerical operations.
- `random`: Library for random number generation.

## Chatbot Functionality

- `chat(data)`: Takes user input `data` and predicts the response using the trained chatbot model.
  - Uses the `Trainer` class to predict the tag and response based on the input.
  - Checks the confidence level (`results[results_index]`) against a threshold (`main.threshold`) to determine the accuracy of the prediction.
  - If the confidence level is above the threshold, selects a random response from the corresponding tag's responses.
  - Handles special cases like getting the current time (`tag == "time"`).

## Usage

1. Initializes the chatbot trainer (`main = Trainer()`).
2. Calls the `chat(data)` function with user input to get the chatbot's response.
