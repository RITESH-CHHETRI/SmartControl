# Training using NLTK, tflearn, and TensorFlow

This code defines a `Trainer` class for training a chatbot using natural language processing techniques. It utilizes NLTK for text processing, tflearn for building and training the neural network, and TensorFlow for deep learning functionalities.

## Libraries

- `os`: Operating system-related functions.
- `json`: Library for working with JSON data.
- `numpy`: Library for numerical operations.
- `nltk`: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing.
- `tflearn`: High-level neural network library built on TensorFlow.
- `tensorflow`: Deep learning framework for building and training models.
- `pickle`: Library for object serialization.

## Trainer Class

- `__init__(self, threshold=0.7, ignore=['?','. ', ','])`: Initializes the chatbot trainer with parameters like threshold for confidence level and characters to ignore in text processing.
- `train(self)`: Prepares training data by tokenizing text, stemming words, and creating a bag of words for training the model.
- `modeler(self)`: Builds and trains the neural network model using tflearn.
- `bag_of_words(self, s, words)`: Converts input text into a bag of words representation for prediction.

## Training Process

1. Loads intents data from a JSON file (`intents.json`).
2. Tokenizes text and preprocesses it using NLTK.
3. Creates a bag of words representation for training examples and labels.
4. Builds and trains a neural network model using tflearn.
5. Saves the trained model for future use.

## Neural Network Architecture

- Input layer with a shape corresponding to the number of features in the training data.
- Two hidden layers with 8 nodes each.
- Output layer with softmax activation for multi-class classification.

## Usage

Instantiate the `Trainer` class and use its methods to train and save the chatbot model. The trained model can then be used for making predictions and responding to user inputs in a chatbot application.
